# Fibonacci-Generators
Finding n Fibonacci numbers with the help of generators

The first n Fibonacci numbers are generated with a generator.

What is the Fibonacci Series?

Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding ones:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

Why a Generator?

Instead of creating the whole series in memory, a generator yields one value at a time, making it memory efficient and lazy (in a good way!).

What I Learned:

ðŸ”¹yield helps pause and resume execution

ðŸ”¹Generators are special iterators

ðŸ”¹Efficient way to handle large or infinite sequences
